# Data-Analysis

These files are each one method analyzing skewed data that doesn't fit easily into a parameteric method.
They are:
1. Hinkley Trans: Used to find the optimum power transformation for symmetery.
2. Letter Values: Used to understand the distribtion of outliers. Each letter value is the nth, 2^n outer median.
3. Spread vs Level: Used to find the optimal transformation when there is an increase of decrease in spread by level.
4. Ureda Trans: Use this to find the optimal power transformation for symmetery by using the letter value function.
5. Three Group: Used to fit a straight line in contaminated data. It is very robust.
